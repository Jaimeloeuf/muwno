  // changed to navigate the user to the last working page, it still shows
  // the global error view component.

  // The 100 milliseconds timeout value is arbitrary, it needs to be long
  // enough for the router-back update to take effect but not too long that it
  // seems like the clear error action froze, and 100ms is a good in between.

          Main dynamic content from router-view.

          Suspense slots expect a single root node and cannot support fragments
          in components, therefore an extra `div` is used to wrap it to only
          have a single element passed to Suspense's default slot.

          A template tag cannot be used instead as it is compiled away and will
          just end up exposing the fragment to Suspense again. Therefore a div
          has to be used. A `template` tag would also require the #default slot
          name to be specified since the template tag is part of the slot API
          and cannot be used directly without any slot name since that will just
          mean that the default slot becomes empty.
